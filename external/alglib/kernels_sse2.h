DEFINITIONS:
* "ALGLIB" – software delivered by Licensor  to  Licensee  under  present
  Agreement. ALGLIB may include  Binary  Components  (delivered  only  in
  binary form) and Source  Code  Components  (with  optional  precompiled
  binary form).  ALGLIB  includes  integrated  third  party  software  as
  defined by clause 1 of the Appendix B which is considered as a part  of
  ALGLIB for the purposes of the present Agreement. Optional third  party
  software (as defined by clause 2 of Appendix B) is not considered as  a
  part of ALGLIB (even when such software is bundled with ALGLIB) and has
  its own licensing terms.
* "Application"  -  program  developed  by  Licensee  (either  standalone
  application or software development library) which includes  ALGLIB  as
  one of its parts .
* "Sublicensee"  -  any  party  (including  resellers)   which   receives
  Application from Licensee or another Sublicensee.
* "Application License Agreement"  -  agreement  which   governs   usage/
  redistribution of the Application.
  
LICENSE GRANT:
Subject to the License Restrictions below, Licensor  grants  to  Licensee
the following non-exclusive royalty-free licenses:
A. To modify Source Code Components of ALGLIB and to use modified version
   on the terms of this Agreement.
B. To  develop  Applications  which  use  ALGLIB  and  to distribute such
   Applications in Binary and/or Source Code forms,  with  ALGLIB  either
   statically or dynamically linked. This right is granted provided that:
   * distribution of Source Code forms of Application/ALGLIB is performed
     subject to additional conditions set by clause H (this clause is not
     applied to binary-only distribution)
   * such Applications add significant  primary  functionality  different
     from that of the ALGLIB.
   * such Applications do not expose ALGLIB API (application  programming
     interface) either directly or indirectly
   * Sublicensee  has  no   right   to  use  ALGLIB  except  as  part  of
     the Application
   * any  subsequent  redistribution   respects    conditions    of   the
     present Agreement
   * all Licensee’s developers using ALGLIB should register at  company's
     account at www.alglib.net
C. To use Resellers for distribution of the  Application  (in  Binary  or
   Source Code forms), provided that the only activity Reseller  performs
   with Application is redistribution.
   
LICENSE RESTRICTIONS:
D. Licensee/Sublicensee may NOT use, copy or distribute ALGLIB except  as
   provided in this Agreement.
D2. Licensee/Sublicensee may NOT rent or lease ALGLIB to any third party.
E. Licensee/Sublicensee may NOT disassemble, reverse engineer, decompile,
   modify Binary Components of ALGLIB or compiled forms  of  Source  Code
   components.
F. Licensee/Sublicensee  may  NOT  remove  any  copyright notice from the
   Source Code / Binary Components.
G. Licensee/Sublicensee may NOT  disable/remove  code  which  checks  for
   presence of license keys (if such code is included in ALGLIB) from the
   Source Code / Binary Components.
H. Distribution of  Source  Code  forms  of  Application/ALGLIB  must  be
   performed subject to additional conditions:
   * Source Code Components of ALGLIB are distributed only as part of the
     Application. They are not  publicly  distributed.  Sublicensee  must
     explicitly accept Application License Agreement in order  to  access
     ALGLIB source code.
   * Sublicensee has no right to redistribute Application/ALGLIB (in  any
     form, Binary or Source Code), unless Sublicensee is Reseller who  is
     fully compliant with conditions set by clause C.
   * Sublicensee has no right to modify ALGLIB Source  Code,  except  for
     the purpose of fixing bugs
   * Sublicensee has no right to workaround "use ALGLIB only as  part  of
     the Application" limitation by sequentially modifying Application in
     a way which effectively creates new program with different  purpose.
     Application   License  Agreement  may  (a)  explicitly  forbid  such
     modifications, or (b) allow only limited set of "safe" modifications
     (developing plugins, fixing bugs, modifying only specific  parts  of
     the Application).
